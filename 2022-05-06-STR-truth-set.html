      <h2>Genome-wide STR Truth Set for Tool Benchmarking and Development<div style="color:grey; position:relative; float:right; font-size:15px">5/6/2022</div></h2>
<p>Short tandem repeat (STR) expansions are associated with over 50 monogenic diseases [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8205997/">Depienne 2021</a>] as well as common diseases such as autism [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9348607/">Trost 2020</a>] [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03078-7">Mitra 2021</a>]. Over the past 5 years, improvements in STR genotyping tools such as <a href="https://github.com/Illumina/ExpansionHunter">ExpansionHunter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gymreklab/GangSTR">GangSTR</a> have generated new interest in studying STRs using short read sequencing data. </p>
<p>However, one persistant challenge with designing and scaling up STR analyses is the scarcity of publicly available high-quality truth data (ie. samples with known STR expansions) that can be used for:
1. comparing tools
2. evaluatating tool accuracy beyond the ~50 known disease-associated loci
3. further tool development, including genotype quality filters</p>
<p>In this blog post, I share a new genome-wide STR truth set that partially addresses this challenge. It is based on the Synthetic Diploid Bechmark (SynDip) [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6341484/">Li 2018</a>] and contains accurate genotypes for ~150,000 STR variants in a single human sample (CHM1-CHM13). The PCR-free genome sequencing data for this sample is publicly available from the <a href="https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/?view=run_browser&amp;acc=ERR1341796&amp;display=data-access">Short Read Archive (SRA)</a> and also from the Broad Institute - including both <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/broad-public-datasets/CHM1_CHM13_WGS2">genome data</a> and <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/broad-public-datasets/CHM1_CHM13_WES">exome data</a>.</p>
<p>I apply this truth set to evaluate widely-used STR calling tools - ExpansionHunter, GangSTR, HipSTR and ExpansionHunter Denovo, and also use it to explore relevant questions about STRs in general such as:
- what is the distribution of STR variants in the human genome (ie. motif sizes, lengths, percent multiallelic, etc.)?
- how well do widely-used catalogs of STR loci capture these variants?
- how many STR variants in an average human genome are expected to be novel (ie. have a motif or repeat locus not present in the hg38 reference genome)?</p>
<hr />
<h4>Summary of Findings</h4>
<p>Some of the more interesting and/or surprising results from the truth set analysis are listed below. These are based on a survey of all STR variants in a single human genome of european ancestry - the CHM1-CHM13 synthetic diploid sample from [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6341484/">Li 2018</a>]. They can be considered as findings from an n=1 case study. </p>
<ul>
<li>An individual's genome differs from the reference at ~150,000 STR loci, but 98% of these alleles are within +/-30bp of the reference locus size. On average, only several thousand STR loci differ from the reference by more than 30bp.</li>
<li>99.6% of STR variants occured at STR loci in the reference genome. Only 521 STR variants had novel motifs that were entirely different from the adjacent motifs or refence sequence context.</li>
<li>ExpansionHunter has better accuracy than GangSTR or HipSTR across the entire range of STR allele sizes.</li>
<li>widely-used STR catalogs would miss 35% to 40% of the STR variants in the truth set. To capture more than 95% of these STR variants using a catalog generated by TandemRepeatFinder, we find we need to start with a catalog that contains 2.8 million STR loci. </li>
<li>pLI gene constraint is useful but insufficient for identifing genes that are intolerant of STR variation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sections below describe these findings in detail.</p>
<p><em>NOTE</em>: STRs are traditionally defined as repeating motifs that are between 1 to 6bp long. For this truth set I exclude 1bp (homopolymer) repeats since they are uniquely error-prone, but include motifs longer than 6bp so that users can decide whether to include these in their analyses.</p>
<h4>Tool Comparison Plots</h4>
<p>These plots compare tool performance for various subsets of loci from the truth set. Detailed discussion of these plots and parameters can be found in the sections below. </p>

<h3>Defining the STR truth set</h3>
<p>To generate an STR truth set, I started with the Synthetic Diploid Benchmark (SynDip) [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6341484/">Li 2018</a>] which is a unique dataset that uses haploid PacBio assemblies to identify all variants in the CHM1-CHM13 synthetic diploid sample. Because these variants are based on alignments of haploid assemblies (rather than individual reads) to the reference genome, the SynDip genotypes are more reliable than those produced by short-read or even ordinary long-read pipelines. </p>
<p>Of the 4.1 million high-confidence variants in the <a href="https://github.com/lh3/CHM-eval">SynDip VCF</a>, 259k (6.3%) are insertions and 249k (6.1%) are deletions. To create the STR truth set, I filtered these insertions and deletions to the subset that represents STR expansions or contractions by using the following steps:</p>
<table>
   <tr>
      <th> </th>
      <th>Filtering Step</th>
      <th nowrap># of Variants<br />That Passed</th>
      <th nowrap align="right">%</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td><i>1</i></td>

   <tr>

      <td>Keep only insertions and deletions</td>
      <td nowrap align="right">507,603</td>
      <td nowrap align="right">12.4 %</td>
   </tr>

   <tr>
      <td><i>3</i></td>
      <td>Identify the subset that are STR expansions or contractions (requiring that they have ≥ 3 repeats, span ≥ 9bp, are pure (ie. no interuptions), and have motif size ≥ 2bp)</td>
      <td nowrap align="right">146,618</td>
      <td nowrap align="right">3.6 %</td>
   </tr>

</table>

<p><br /></p>
<p><img width="85" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/200182718-67b467b0-80a6-49ae-b147-56a8bb0cf655.png"></p>
<p>This example walks through how to determine whether an InDel actually represents an STR expansion or contraction. </p>
<p>Let's say the SynDip truth set contains this insertion:   <img width="275" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/200183159-d42914b0-9636-4584-a593-dcb86463ff14.png"></p>
<p>Should we include it in the STR truth set?  </p>
<p><em>step 1</em>: find the minimal motif (<strong>GGC</strong>) in the inserted sequence (<strong>GGCGGC</strong>) by using brute force k-mer search similar to <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.18.469113v1">STRling</a>.<br />
<em>step 2</em>: check the reference context for additional <strong>GGC</strong> repeats immediately to the left or right of the variant:  </p>
<p align="center"><img width="350" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/200182871-639e7282-07a1-4587-8592-453d68622383.png"></center></p>

<p>Here, the reference contains 9 additional GGC repeats so the variant can be represented as having  </p>
<p><strong>9 x GGC repeats in the reference allele</strong><br />
<strong>11 x GGC repeats in the alternate allele</strong>   </p>
<p>This variant passes the thresholds for length ≥ 9bp and repeat count ≥ 3, so <strong>we add it to STR truth set</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Validation</h3>
<p>The SynDip benchmark is based on samples from two individuals: CHM1 and CHM13. One of them (CHM13) is also the basis of the new <a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/telomere-to-telomere">telomere-to-telomere</a> (T2T) reference genome, so it's possible to validate most STR variants in the truth set by checking that at least one allele matches the T2T reference sequence.</p>

      <td nowrap align="right">0 %</td>
   </tr>

</table>

<p>Overall, of the 86,028 STRs that could be validated <sup>‡</sup> against T2T, 84,183 (97.9%) passed this validation, underscoring the accuracy and relevance of this truth set. </p>
<p>‡ <em>NOTE</em>: STR contractions that failed hg38 ⇒ T2T liftover due to an  “IndelStraddlesMultipleIntevals” error were included in the truth set without these validation steps as I consider this to be a technical issue with liftover rather than a problem with genotype accuracy. This applies to 60,590 (77%) of STR contractions.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Results:</h3>
<p>The resulting STR truth set contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>144,773 STR variants</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>175,372 STR alleles</strong>   </li>
</ul>
<p>The size distribution of these alleles is as follows:</p>
<p><img width=500 src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/200637637-32348eff-13bc-4c10-9cbb-c52304709859.png"></p>
<p>Here, the x-axis represents the STR allele size in CHM1-CHM13 minus the number of repeats at that locus in the hg38 reference genome. The distribution is symmetric around 0 - which is as expected since there's no reason for STRs in hg38 to be systematically larger or smaller than repeats in random individuals from the  population (ie. CHM1 and CHM13). To take it a step further, this symmetry provides further support for the truth set's accuracy since it rules out systematic bias toward expansions or contractions in the pipeline that produced the SynDip Benchmark. </p>
<p>If I plot the same distribution but with size in base pairs rather than # of repeats on the x-axis, it looks like:</p>
<p><img width=500 src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/201500475-561acf00-3b52-43b6-9a27-b1846ce76ddd.png"></p>
<p>To summarize, only 3,037 STR alleles (1.7%) differ by more than 30bp from the reference genome, and only 849 (0.5%) differ by more than 60bp. Although there are many STR variants, the overwhelming majority add or subtract only a few repeats. </p>
<p>We can also look at the prevalence of STR variants with different motifs and compare it to the distribution of pure STR repeats in hg38 (found using <a href="https://github.com/Benson-Genomics-Lab/TRF">TandemRepeatFinder</a>):</p>
<div nowrap align=center>
<img width=400 src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/200649782-9c128fa7-fe46-4593-bb54-5e42bb546217.png">
<img width="148" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/200648659-7b827c97-b95d-4713-947c-bca349cf36c4.png">
<img width=400 src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/200649509-d8a1fd0d-4dbc-4e4b-9ab4-82eb9566b5cb.png">
</div>

<p>Here the motifs are sorted by how common they are in hg38. 
Although the 2 distributions are roughly similar, some motifs clearly have more STR variants than others. </p>
<p>30,599 out of 144,773 (21%) STR variants are multiallelic (ie. have 2 non-reference alleles), reflecting the high mutation rates of STR loci.</p>
<div align=center>
<img width=850 src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/200898063-bcdfdfe6-1496-4997-b95d-192f83e08ceb.png">
</div>

<p>Finally, we can also ask - for STR variants in the truth set, how large are the corresponding loci in the hg38 reference genome? 
and also, if a locus has many repeats in the reference genome, is it more likely to be expanded or contracted in CHM1-CHM13?<br />
These plots address those questions:</p>
<p><img width=615 src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/204148709-ab45e9b2-e808-4daa-a089-107b3139811b.png"></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, truth set variants at loci where the reference sequence contains relatively few repeats are more likely to be expanded, while loci that have many repeats in the reference are more likely to be contracted in the truth set. </p>
<h3>Genomic regions</h3>
<p>How are truth set STR variants distributed across various annotated regions of the genome?</p>
<p>3,121 out of 144,773 (2.2%) STR variants overlap segmental duplications (SegDups) in hg38:</p>
<div align=center>

<p><em>NOTE: promoters are defined as just a 1kb window upstream of the 5' start of any transcript</em></p>
<p>Showing the MANE v1 proportions as a histogram stratified by motif sizes:</p>
<div align=left>
<img width="500" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/202269863-abc40ef0-35c1-428a-8065-ccb37b29157c.png">
</div>

<p>If we filter out STRs that are intergenic, intronic or overlap non-coding exons, and look only at the small subset that overlap either promoters, UTRs or coding regions (CDS), the histogram looks like:</p>
<div align=left>
<img width=500 src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/200899334-703e84af-0b10-4c4c-9bb6-fa80efa8cf22.png">
</div>

<p>This shows that nearly all - 198 out of 203 (97.5%) - of the STR alleles in coding regions have motif sizes that are multiples of 3bp.<br />
As for the 5 loci that don't fit this pattern, 3 have very large motifs - larger than 50bp, 1 is an out-of-frame expansion of the rare "GC" dinucleotide motif, and 1 is an expansion of a 5bp "GGGGC" motif that adds 3 additional repeats relative to the reference and so does not introduce a frameshift. </p>
<p>We can also look at whether the 203 coding STR alleles fall within LoF or missense constrained genes and compare this to the gene constraint of the 25 known disease-associated loci that are within coding regions. </p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/202306770-ad9d07b8-159d-49a4-930d-ad0e72deae4e.png" /></p>
<p>From this, we see that disease-associated STRs are much more likely to be in constrained genes, implying that both missense and LoF constraint computed from SNVs is also relevant for STRs. On the other hand, just because a gene is constrained doesn't mean that in-frame STR variants in that gene cause disease since many of the truth set STRs fall in highly constrained genes.</p>
<p>Another way to look at this is to see whether larger STR variants are less likely to be in constrained genes. This might not be enough data to say, but at least for larger expansions, pLI is more likely to be near 0. Here, each dot represents a coding STR allele in the truth set, and contractions relative to the reference are negative on the y-axis:
<img alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/202331857-f5cf777c-37d5-4342-b3c7-60aab7e096a5.png" /></p>
<h4>Novel STR loci</h4>
<p>Unlike variant calling tools for SNVs and structural variants which take only read alignments (bam or cram) as input, nearly all STR genotyping tools besides <a href="https://github.com/Illumina/ExpansionHunterDenovo">ExpansionHunterDenovo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/quinlan-lab/STRling">STRling</a> require users to also provide the exact boundaries and motifs of the STR loci to genotype. For example, to genotype the Huntington's Disease locus, a user must specify the reference coordinates "chr4:3074876-3074933" and motif "CAG". The implicit assumption of these algorithms is that all STRs a user might want to genotype are also present in the reference genome - meaning that STR variants look like:</p>
<p><img width="452" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/200219094-78f3ad2f-bcba-4412-a5cb-098e8f6b56a8.png"></p>
<p>rather than </p>
<p><img width="450" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/200219024-2464a379-b1b9-4569-ba3d-d6a47583c357.png"></p>
<p>The truth set allows us to check the degree to which this assumption is valid. It turns out that it is almost 100%:</p>
<ul>
<li>144,158 out of 144,773 (99.6%) of STR variants in CHM1-CHM13 match repeats found in hg38 immediately to the left or right of the variant. Only 521 variants are novel STRs, and they are all intergenic (based on Gencode v42).</li>
</ul>
<p>This suggests that, for samples like CHM1-CHM13 that have European ancestry, nearly all true STR variants can be found by using a large enough STR catalog generated from the reference genome. </p>
<h4>Limitations of existing STR catalogs</h4>
<p>An important question for any genome-wide STR analysis using tools like ExpansionHunter or GangSTR is which STR catalog to genotype. </p>

<p>One takeaway is that, if we want to capture more than 95% of STR variants using a TRF-derived catalog, we need to genotype more than 2.8M loci genome-wide in each individual. </p>
<p>This takeaway is based on the entire truth set - but does is it still true for larger loci - for example the 89,622 (62%) of loci where the reference locus spans at least 24bp? Yes - both the GangSTR and Illumina catalogs would miss 30% to 45% of these variants.</p>
<p>What about loci with relatively large expansions? Arguably these are the loci we're most interested in. If you filter the truth set to the 1,702 (1%) of STR expansions that add 10 or more repeats to the reference repeat count, the percenages of missed loci remain large - with 30% missed by the GangSTR v17 catalog and 45% missed by the Illumina catalog.

<h3>Tool comparisons</h3>
<p>Using the truth set to compare accuracy of existing STR callers requires us to first define what we mean by accuracy. 
For other variant types such as SNVs and InDels, the definition is relatively straight-forward - a tool will either call a variant or not, and then it might get the zygosity right or wrong, but that's about it. These metrics are also important for STRs, but the additional aspect of number of repeats introduces a lot more nuance. For example, for a given STR locus, a tool may get the number of repeats exactly right, or it may be off by +/-1, or off by many repeats. It might even call an expansion where the true genotype is a contraction. To avoid getting bogged down in finding the right definition, we can begin with the simplest definition and build from there. </p>
<p>Also, to keep the analysis manageable, we focus on several widely-used tools - ExpansionHunter, GangSTR and HipSTR, and later also look at ExpansionHunterDenovo.</p>
<h4>Exact accuracy</h4>
<p>The simplest definition of STR calling accuracy is - how many genotypes did a tool get exactly right? ie. what fraction of called allele sizes exactly match the corresponding allele size in the truth set. When we run ExpansionHunter, GangSTR and HipSTR on the 139,244 (96%) truth set loci that have 2bp to 6bp motifs and that are present in the reference genome, we find that accuracy varies as follows: </p>
<table>
   <tr>
      <th>Tool</th>
      <th>Accuracy @ 40x <br />genome coverage</th>
      <th>Accuracy @ 20x <br />genome coverage</th>
      <th>Accuracy @ 10x <br />genome coverage</th>
      <th>Accuracy @ 5x  <br />genome coverage</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td nowrap>ExpansionHunter v5</td>
      <td>92.6%</td>
      <td>90.9%</td>
      <td>83.3%</td>
      <td>0.1%</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td nowrap>GangSTR v2.5</td>
      <td>91.0%</td>
      <td>87.1%</td>
      <td>76.1%</td>
      <td>53.5%</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td nowrap>HipSTR v0.6.2</td>
      <td>74.0%</td>
      <td>72.9%</td>
      <td>65.9%</td>
      <td>42.5%</td>
   </tr>
</table>

<p>We can see that ExpansionHunter slightly outperforms GangSTR, and both tools outperform HipSTR. Unsurprisingly, accuracy decreases when the original data (which has 40x genome-wide coverage) is downsampled to lower read depths.</p>
<h4>Exact accuracy by number of repeats</h4>
<p>For most STR analyses, we care more about large expansions than about variants that only add or remove a few repeats. 
However, as we saw <a href="https://github.com/bw2/bw2.github.io/blob/master/2022-05-06-STR-truth-set.md#results">previously</a>, the overwhelming majority of truth set variants only differ from the reference genome by 1 or 2 repeats. This means the accuracy metric defined above is dominated by variants we don't care as much about. To improve on this, we can look at how accuracy varies across different true allele size bins. </p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> First though, a technical note about comparing STR genotypes. For a given locus, there are 5 numbers to consider - the number of repeats in the reference genome, the true size of the short allele and the long allele, and finally the short and long allele as called by the given tool. 
For the analyses below, the x-axis values come from comparing the true allele sizes to the number of repeats in the reference. Then, to determine tool accuracy at a locus, the true genotype as well as the tool's reported genotype can be split into a short allele and a long allele. The short alleles can be compared, and then, separately, the long alleles:</p>
<p><img width="900" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/211596717-1fba3b72-2549-46b2-9f04-da96cb868f50.png">
<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Now, we can look at the fraction of alleles that each tool gets exactly right:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/211717620-48e83eb2-dcb3-4b81-8fe6-16658552b022.png" width=800></div>

<p>This plot represents calls @ 40x coverage, and shows how accuracy drops for larger expansions (positive x-axis) as well as large contractions (negative x-axis), with ExpansionHunter retaining higher accuracy across all bins.</p>
<p>HipSTR shows poor accuracy largely because it refuses to call many loci, instead outputting the error message: "Aborting genotyping of the locus as the sequence upstream/downstream of the repeat is too repetitive for accurate genotyping". If we exclude these loci from the analysis for all tools - thereby discarding 25,257 out of 139,244 (18.1%) of truth set loci that have 2 to 6bp motifs - the above plot then looks like:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/211717395-b8ff12d9-a80e-45e3-8a8a-36a83de5845e.png" width=800></div>

<p>This shows that, even on the subset of loci that HipSTR can genotype, its accuracy is roughly the same as GangSTR's and worse than ExpansionHunter's. </p>
<p>Next, we can look at how accuracy varies for different sequencing coverage depths, showing only ExpansionHunter and GangSTR for clarity:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/211717485-6d2bda31-221d-4560-b164-106deaf65d17.png" width=800></div>

<h4>Accuracy and error size</h4>
<p>When a tool doesn't get the genotype exactly right, it matters whether it's off by 1 or by 20 repeats, and whether it tends to overestimate or underestimate the true genotype. This is especially important for rare disease cases where underestimating expansions can lead to missed diagnoses. We can use different colors to add information about the size and direction of errors:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/211718144-989a08dd-d9d9-49ce-abe8-9f60b30c8edb.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>Here, green shows allele sizes that ExpansionHunter got exactly right and so represents the same fraction of calls as the plots in the previous section. Orange represents alleles that ExpansionHunter overestimated (with darker orange meaning a bigger overestimate), while blue represents alleles that ExpansionHunter underestimated (with darker blues representing larger errors). Additional colors include gray for the few loci where ExpansionHunter didn't produce a genotype (such as due to insufficient coverage), red represents the loci that ExpansionHunter called as homozygous reference and so entirely missed the variant, brown is where ExpansionHunter incorrectly called an allele as being heterozygous reference, and teal is for alleles where ExpansionHunter called a contraction but the true allele size was an expansion or vice versa.
The plot shows that ExpansionHunter errs in both directions - overestimating some expansions and underestimating others.   </p>
<p>We can compare this to other tools:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/211718101-f96f615f-0189-40e4-bf3a-24c1b4924c63.png" width="100%">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/211718053-77ed9a3f-b708-458a-984d-3bdee3a716c5.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>This shows that both GangSTR and HipSTR underestimate (blue) or entirely miss (red) more expansions than ExpansionHunter. </p>
<h4>Exome data</h4>
<p>Since exome sequencing data is available for the CHM1-CHM13 sample, we can check what fraction of the truth set can be called in an exome. To exclude off-target regions that accidentally had some read coverage, we prefilter loci to exclude those that are intergenic, intronic or in promoters (based on Gencode v42 annotations), and also exclude loci where neither ExpansionHunter nor GangSTR produced a genotype. Out of the 139,244 truth set loci with 2 to 6bp motifs, only 1,766 (1.3%) pass these filters. Even for this small subset, more than half of the genotype calls are inaccurate. </p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/211717914-551d32b6-7407-4470-aff3-85c190569f6b.png" width="100%">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6240170/211717960-7d5aeda2-0a54-4389-976b-9273eda8fe00.png" width="100%"></p>
<h4>ExpansionHunterDenovo</h4>
<p>ExpansionHunterDenovo [<a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-02017-z">Dolzhenko 2020</a>] is a widely used tool that differs from  ExpansionHunter, GangSTR and most other STR callers in significant ways. First, it looks for STR expansions genome-wide, without requiring the user to pre-specify which loci it should call. Second, it has an important technical limiation - it can only detect loci where the combined length of the repeat sequence in the reference genome + the STR variant exceeds ~150bp (or whatever the read length is in the input sample). Finally, for the loci it does detect, it only outputs a rough estimate of the repeat size and approximate genomic coordinates (+/- several hundred base pairs). These approximate values are then used for outlier tests that aim to detect unusually large expansions in each sample relative to other samples in the cohort.</p>
<p>Here, I use the truth set to check how well the ExpansionHunterDenovo "profile" step picks up large expansions in CHM1-CHM13-2:</p>
<p>This plot confirms that the ExpansionHunterDenovo "profile" step has high sensitivity for pure repeat loci that exceed 150bp. It also shows that ExpansionHunterDenovo detects novel expansions - those that have no matching repeats in the reference genome.  </p>
<p>Specificity is harder to estimate. We can look at the distribution of loci that ExpansionHunterDenovo's "profile" step outputs even though there is no pure STR expansion anywhere near that location according to the truth set. There are two important caveats to this analysis. First, while the truth set (for now) only includes pure repeats, ExpansionHunterDenovo allows interruptions in the repeat sequence - when detecting which reads are repetative, it uses a heuristic algorithm that requires at least 85% of a read's sequence to be consistant with a pure repeat of some motif. This means that a subset of the loci it outputs are not in the truth set because they contain interruptions. Second, while the truth set only includes loci with STR variants, the "profile" step doesn't distinguish between loci where the sample differs from the reference vs loci where there is simply a long (longer than 150bp) repeat in the reference genome. Despite these limitations, a comparison of ExpansionHunterDenovo "profile" results vs the truth set helps to build intuition about which loci  ExpansionHunterDenovo focuses on:</p>
<h4>Interruptions</h4>
<p>The analyses above are all based on pure repeats. To see how allowing interruptions may affect the results, </p>
<h4>Runtime comparison</h4>
<p>I also creatd a modififed version of ExpansionHunter which, by using an additional read cache, runs 2 to 3x faster than the original 
while producing the same output. </p>
<hr />
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>The truth set and tool results provide an opportunity to identify features that distinguish
- True positive genotypes vs. false-positive STR genotypes
- STR loci where tools tend to produce accurate vs. inaccurate genotypes
- STR loci that are mutated in CHM1-CHM13 vs those that are not</p>
<p>A key next step is to train classifiers for these categories.</p>

</ul>
<p>TODO describe other scripts here</p>
<p>To run ExpansionHunter, GangSTR, and HipSTR on this sample, I generated variant catalogs with
1) 144,251 positive loci. These are all the loci in the truth set (excluding the 521 that don't have matching repeats in the reference genome). They represent true positive variants.
2) 144,252 negative loci. These are repeat loci in hg38 that are not in the truth set (and therefore have a homozygous reference genotype). They represent true negatives. They were selected by taking the much larger set of all pure repeats in hg38 and selecting a random subset that has the same distribution of motif sizes as the set of positive loci. </p>
<p>These variant catalogs and other files used in the analysis are publicly available in the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/str-truth-set/hg38">gs://str-truth-set</a> Google Storage bucket.

<p><strong>Extra Section 3:</strong> Genome-wide STR catalogs via TandemRepeatFinder</p>
<p>To generate a comprehensive catalog of pure repeats in hg38, I ran <a href="https://github.com/Benson-Genomics-Lab/TRF">TandemRepeatFinder</a> with very large mismatch and indel penalties (=1000000) that basically disallow any mismatches or indels. I used a small Minscore value (=8) to include short stretches of repeats:</p>
<p><code>trf catalog.txt 2 1000000 1000000 80 10 8 2000 -ngs -d</code></p>
<p>I then post-processed the output to discard homopolymers and loci than contained fewer than 3 repeats of a motif. Also, I trimmed the loci so that the locus size was an exact multiple of the motif size. These are the results (filtered to different minimum locus size thresholds):</p>

<p>Although it wasn't used in the truth set analyses, I also generated a repeat catalog by running <a href="https://github.com/Benson-Genomics-Lab/TRF">TandemRepeatFinder</a> with a more permissive mismatch penalty (=7) to capture some of the loci missed in the above catalog - such as known pathogenic loci that have interruptions in their reference repeat sequence. I kept the indel penalty very large (=1000000):</p>
<p><code>trf catalog.txt 2 7 1000000 80 10 8 2000 -ngs -d</code>
As before, I post-processed the output to discard homopolymers and loci than contained fewer than 3 repeats of a motif. The resulting catalog is available here:</p>

<p>This catalog has fewer loci than the catalog of pure repeats because a number of adjacent pure repeat loci were merged into single loci once mismatches were allowed. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Extra Section 4:</strong> This section summarizes the limitations of other ways to estimate STR tool accuracy:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>simulated STRs:</strong> we can generate an unlimited number of STR examples with known genotypes by using a tool like <a href="https://github.com/lh3/wgsim">wgsim</a>. However, simulated data doesn't capture the full complexity of real sequencing data (eg. adjacent variants not present in the reference genome, GC bias, and other sequencing artifacts). </li>
<li><strong>mendelian violations analysis:</strong> trios can be used to check whether genotypes are consistant with Mendelian inheritance. However, This is informative about specificity but not sensitivity since a tool that misses all expansions will have zero mendelian violations. This produces a coarser<br />
   truth set since it's impossible to say whether any individual mendelian violation is error or truth - just that 
   overall, there should be no more than ~80 mendelian violations on average per trio (based on the estimated denovo rate for STR 
   variants [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5482724/?report=classic">Willems 2017</a>]). Additionally, 
   mendelian violations are confounded by a tool's false-negative rate since a tool that consistently fails to detect 
   STR expansions at some loci will have fewer mendelian violations.</li>
<li><strong>PCR-validated pathogenic expansions:</strong> A small number of WGS samples with PCR-validated STR expansions are publicly available - including 9 
   samples from [<a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1505-2">Dashnow 2018</a>]. Typically only one locus is validated in        each sample, so there's too little data in this category to be useful for a genome-wide STR benchmark. Additionally, PCR and other related methods 
   often give only approximate expansion sizes (eg. "greater than 150 repeats"). This is sufficient for determining 
   pathogenicity but not for evaluating tool accuracy.   </li>
<li><strong>long read data:</strong> This might be the ideal source of truth in the future, but currently suffers from a lack of well-validated STR calling tools. The most-recently published tool - Straglr [<a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-021-02447-3">Chiu 2021</a>] - reports 73% concordance between heterozygous STR expansions called from HiFi PacBio data vs truth data generated from the diploid assembly of HG00733 [<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/327064v2.full">Kronenberg 2019</a>]. [<a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-021-02447-3">Chiu 2021</a>], [<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.18.469113v1">Dashnow 2021</a>] and other groups (unpublished) also raise concerns about diploid assemblies as a source of STR truth data since manual inspection of discordant loci often revealed that the assembly was not credible at those loci. </li>

<p><strong>Extra Section 6:</strong> Synthetic Diploid Benchmark Overview</p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6341484/">Li 2018</a>] produced a high-qaulity truth set based on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5411763/">Huddleston 2017</a> haploid assemblies of two individuals - CHM1 and CHM13. </p>
<p>To create the Synthetic Diploid Benchmark, [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6341484/">Li 2018</a>] generated variant calls by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Aligning each haploid assembly to GRCh37 or GRCh38 using minimap2</li>
<li>Converting the differences revealed by these alignments to variant calls directly from the CIGAR string. There was no need to run a separate variant calling tool downstream of the alignment step.</li>

<p>This yielded 5,362,620 variants of which 4,148,586 were in high-confidence regions.</p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6341484/">Li 2018</a>] used this data to evaluate SNV and INDEL calling tools, but it can also serve as a high-quality truth set for STRs, as well as tandem repeats (TRs) and structural variants (SVs).</p>
