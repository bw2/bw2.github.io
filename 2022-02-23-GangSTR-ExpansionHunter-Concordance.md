ExpansionHunter [[Dolzhenko 2019](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/22/4754/5499079)] and GangSTR [[Mousavi 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31194863/)] 
are widely used tools for genotyping short tandem repeats (STRs) in whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. They are able to genotype both small and lare STR expansions 
(shorter or longer than read length) and rely on very similar features in the WGS data do so.
