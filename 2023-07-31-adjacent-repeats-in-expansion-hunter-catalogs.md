ExpansionHunter has a unique feature where users can specify adjacent STR loci in addition to the main locus being genotyped. 
For example, for the Huntington's disease locus, rather than just specifying the CAG repeat as in:
```
{
    "LocusId": "HTT",
    "LocusStructure": "(CAG)*",
    "ReferenceRegion": "4:3074876-3074933",
    "VariantType": "Repeat",
}
```
the user can add adjacent repeats to locus description - as is done in 
[the official ExpansionHunter catalog](https://github.com/Illumina/ExpansionHunter/blob/master/variant_catalog/grch38/variant_catalog.json#L458-L473):
```
{
    "LocusId": "HTT",
    "LocusStructure": "(CAG)*CAACAG(CCG)*",
    "ReferenceRegion": [
        "4:3074876-3074933",
        "4:3074939-3074966"
    ],
    "VariantId": [
        "HTT",
        "HTT_CCG"
    ],
    "VariantType": [
        "Repeat",
        "Repeat"
    ]
}
```

**Pros and Cons**
- can genotype multiple loci together and use REViewer to see phased visualizations
